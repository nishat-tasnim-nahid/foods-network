                Food is a source of health, energy and enjoyment. Few things in life provide as much pleasure as a
                delicious
                meal shared with family or friends, and nothing can do more for your total health and well-being -
                glowing
                skin,
                bright clear eyes, your stamina and strength, immune system, even your mood - as the right sort of food
                and
                the
                right proportions.
